- Layout
    - Big
        - Logo in the middle, bio and links on the left, showcase nav on the right
    - Little
        - Logo center top, scroll down for the rest (and what happens in the background?)
- Tendrils showcase
    - Light logo in the middle, light background, dark tendrils explode from central circle to separate logo from background.
    - Later, get vector info from the logo SVG and use it to influence flow.
    - Hide controls etc, or maybe keep it separate and link to the Trust visuals?
- Content
    - Left
        - Intro
            - Name? Scramble the letters as a gag on the spelling?
            - Brief one-liner of skills and interests
                - Graded highlight to surface critical info versus scan-readers?
            - CV and platform links
