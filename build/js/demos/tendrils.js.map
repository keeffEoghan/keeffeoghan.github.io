A map by itself also does not retain\n\t * the values associated with that map.\n\t *\n\t * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are\n\t * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are\n\t * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all\n\t * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime\n\t * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even\n\t * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n\t * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as\n\t * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant\n\t * to ongoing computation.\n\t *\n\t * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n\t * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n\t * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):\n\t * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API\n\t * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.\n\t *\n\t * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in\n\t * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,\n\t * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent\n\t * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive\n\t * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods\n\t * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,\n\t * an object of {@code [[Class]]} \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing\n\t * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,\n\t * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being\n\t * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same\n\t * names.\n\t *\n\t * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code\n\t * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the\n\t * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap\n\t * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n\t * channel.

A map by itself also does not retain\n * the values associated with that map.\n *\n * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are\n * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are\n * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all\n * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime\n * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even\n * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as\n * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant\n * to ongoing computation.\n *\n * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):\n * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API\n * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.\n *\n * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in\n * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,\n * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent\n * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive\n * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods\n * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,\n * an object of {@code [[Class]]} \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing\n * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,\n * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being\n * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same\n * names.\n *\n * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code\n * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the\n * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap\n * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this\n * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to\n * prevent access to this channel.
