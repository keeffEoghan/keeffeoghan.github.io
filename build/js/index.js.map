A map by itself also does not retain\n\t * the values associated with that map.\n\t *\n\t * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are\n\t * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are\n\t * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all\n\t * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime\n\t * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even\n\t * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n\t * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as\n\t * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant\n\t * to ongoing computation.\n\t *\n\t * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n\t * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n\t * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):\n\t * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API\n\t * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.\n\t *\n\t * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in\n\t * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,\n\t * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent\n\t * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive\n\t * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods\n\t * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,\n\t * an object of {@code [[Class]]} \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing\n\t * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,\n\t * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being\n\t * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same\n\t * names.\n\t *\n\t * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code\n\t * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the\n\t * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap\n\t * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n\t * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this\n\t * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to\n\t * prevent access to this channel.

The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide an options object to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on\n * the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent calls\n * to the debounced function return the result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

To run this file on an ES5 or almost ES5\n * implementation where the {@code WeakMap} specification does not\n * quite conform, run <code>repairES5.js</code> first.\n *\n * <p>Even though WeakMapModule is not global, the linter thinks it\n * is, which is why it is in the overrides list below.\n *\n * <p>NOTE: Before using this WeakMap emulation in a non-SES\n * environment, see the note below about hiddenRecord.\n *\n * @author Mark S. Miller\n * @requires crypto, ArrayBuffer, Uint8Array, navigator, console\n * @overrides WeakMap, ses, Proxy\n * @overrides WeakMapModule\n */\n\n/**\n * This {@code WeakMap} emulation is observably equivalent to the\n * ES-Harmony WeakMap, but with leakier garbage collection properties.\n *\n * <p>As with true WeakMaps, in this emulation, a key does not\n * retain maps indexed by that key and (crucially) a map does not\n * retain the keys it indexes. A map by itself also does not retain\n * the values associated with that map.\n *\n * <p>However, the values associated with a key in some map are\n * retained so long as that key is retained and those associations are\n * not overridden. For example, when used to support membranes, all\n * values exported from a given membrane will live for the lifetime\n * they would have had in the absence of an interposed membrane. Even\n * when the membrane is revoked, all objects that would have been\n * reachable in the absence of revocation will still be reachable, as\n * far as the GC can tell, even though they will no longer be relevant\n * to ongoing computation.\n *\n * <p>The API implemented here is approximately the API as implemented\n * in FF6.0a1 and agreed to by MarkM, Andreas Gal, and Dave Herman,\n * rather than the offially approved proposal page. TODO(erights):\n * upgrade the ecmascript WeakMap proposal page to explain this API\n * change and present to EcmaScript committee for their approval.\n *\n * <p>The first difference between the emulation here and that in\n * FF6.0a1 is the presence of non enumerable {@code get___, has___,\n * set___, and delete___} methods on WeakMap instances to represent\n * what would be the hidden internal properties of a primitive\n * implementation. Whereas the FF6.0a1 WeakMap.prototype methods\n * require their {@code this} to be a genuine WeakMap instance (i.e.,\n * an object of {@code [[Class]]} \"WeakMap}), since there is nothing\n * unforgeable about the pseudo-internal method names used here,\n * nothing prevents these emulated prototype methods from being\n * applied to non-WeakMaps with pseudo-internal methods of the same\n * names.\n *\n * <p>Another difference is that our emulated {@code\n * WeakMap.prototype} is not itself a WeakMap. A problem with the\n * current FF6.0a1 API is that WeakMap.prototype is itself a WeakMap\n * providing ambient mutability and an ambient communications\n * channel. Thus, if a WeakMap is already present and has this\n * problem, repairES5.js wraps it in a safe wrappper in order to\n * prevent access to this channel.
